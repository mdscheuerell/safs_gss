    description = "<p>We recognize that it can be difficult for graduate students to navigate the various career options available to scientists with advanced degrees in the environmental sciences. Due to the very nature of academic environments, most students have a pretty good idea of what itâ€™s like to be a professor by the time they graduate, but relatively few students have an equal appreciation for the array of alternative career possibilities. Furthermore, although academic careers continue to be a preferred path for some individuals, those jobs are increasingly rare and extremely competitive, and hence more graduates are pursuing non-academic careers. This panel discussion is therefore intended to introduce graduate students to the spectrum of non-academic career options in environmental science, and highlight their importance to society at large."
